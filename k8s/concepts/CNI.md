# Container Network Interface (CNI)

## What is CNI?

The Container Network Interface (CNI) is a standard that defines how the Kubernetes runtime (e.g. kubelet) configures networking for a pod. When a pod is created, the runtime calls a CNI plugin (or a chain of plugins) with commands like ADD/DEL to attach the pod to the cluster network and get an IP.

## Why it matters

- Every pod needs an IP and the ability to talk to other pods and to the outside world.
- CNI decouples "how to wire the pod" from Kubernetes core. You choose a plugin (Calico, Cilium, Flannel, Weave, etc.) and configure it; kubelet uses it for each pod.

## Main concepts

- **CNI plugin**: A binary or script that implements the CNI spec (e.g. ADD container to network, DEL container from network). It is invoked by the container runtime (containerd, CRI-O) when the runtime creates or tears down the pod’s network namespace.
- **Pod network namespace**: Each pod has its own network namespace. The CNI plugin creates a veth pair: one end in the host, one in the pod namespace, and configures IP, routes, and sometimes firewall rules.
- **Plugin chain**: You can chain plugins (e.g. main plugin for IPAM + bridge, then a meta plugin like flannel or a policy plugin).

## Where CNI is configured

- Config: typically `/etc/cni/net.d/` (e.g. `10-calico.conflist`).
- Binaries: typically `/opt/cni/bin/`.
- kubelet passes the network namespace path and container ID to the plugin when it runs ADD/DEL.

## Steps to inspect pod networking

Do these from a node that runs the pod (or from the control plane if you use kubectl from there).

1. **List nodes and get pod placement**
   - `kubectl get nodes -o wide`
   - `kubectl get pods -o wide`  
     Note which node the pod is on.

2. **On that node: list veth interfaces**
   - `ip link show | grep -A 1 "veth"`  
     You should see veth pairs; one end is in the host, the other in the pod’s network namespace.

3. **List network namespaces**
   - `ip netns list`  
     Or: `ls /var/run/netns`  
     Pod namespaces are often named like `cni-<id>` or similar (depends on runtime/CNI).

4. **Inspect the pod’s network namespace**
   - Find the namespace for your pod (from step 3 or from the CNI/containerd metadata).
   - `ip netns exec <pod-namespace> ip addr show`
   - `ip netns exec <pod-namespace> ip route show`  
     This shows the IP and routes inside the pod.

5. **Inspect from inside the pod**
   - `kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- sh`
   - Inside: `ip addr` (or `ip a`), `ip route`, `cat /etc/resolv.conf`  
     This should match what you saw in the pod’s network namespace on the host.

6. **Check CNI config and binaries**
   - `ls /etc/cni/net.d/`
   - `ls /opt/cni/bin/`
   - `cat /etc/cni/net.d/<config>`  
     Confirm the plugin and IPAM settings.

## Useful commands (summary)

From control plane / any machine with kubectl:

- `kubectl get nodes -o wide`
- `kubectl get pods -o wide`
- `kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- ip a`
- `kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- ip route`

On the node (where the pod runs):

- `ip link show | grep -A 1 "veth"`
- `ip netns list`
- `ip netns exec <pod-namespace> ip addr show`
- `ls /etc/cni/net.d/` and `cat /etc/cni/net.d/<file>`

## Troubleshooting

- Pod has no IP / "NetworkPlugin not ready": check that the CNI binary exists, config is valid, and the CNI plugin pods (if any, e.g. Calico node) are running. Check kubelet logs.
- Can’t see pod namespace with `ip netns list`: some runtimes (e.g. containerd) require creating a symlink from `/var/run/netns/<name>` to the namespace handle; check the runtime’s CNI docs.
- Pod can’t reach other pods or services: verify routes and IPAM (address allocation), and that any overlay or firewall plugin (e.g. Calico, Cilium) is healthy.
